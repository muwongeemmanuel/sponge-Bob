					Karin has been a lead teacher at St. Mark’s School in various classrooms since 2006. She is a native San Diegan, born and raised in 
					Clairemont. Her parents emigrated to the U.S. from Norway and her family continues to have strong ties to the Norwegian culture. 
					Karin has two adult daughters – my oldest, Stefanie, is married to Randy and they own a home together. You may already know her younger 
					daughter; she is Ms. Amanda, also a lead teacher on staff here. Karin is an avid reader and has a black lab named Edda who was adopted 
					from a rescue organization – she’s her baby girl and a wonderful companion.
				</p>
				<p style="color:white;text-align:;padding-left:20px;">
					Karin has been teaching preschool since the fall of 2000 and can say with certainty that working with young children is truly her passion.
					She loves the wonder, curiosity and persistence of preschoolers; it is always exciting to see them figure things out – the sky’s the limit 
					for them! Karin earned an A.S. in Child Development from Mesa College and a B.A. in Fine Art from SDSU. She also holds a Site Supervisor 
					Permit through the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing, which allows her to mentor college students and to fill in as a 
					preschool site supervisor, if needed. She looks for opportunities for professional development and attends workshops regularly to 
					keep current with what’s happening in the field and to gain new inspiration. Karin is happy to be a part of this caring community of 
					educators and families – St. Mark’s is a great place for kids!
